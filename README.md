➼ During this internship program, I consolidated and visualized sales, customer, and inventory data, resulting in a 20% increase in sales through data-driven promotional strategies.

➼ By analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns, I identified key segments and optimized marketing efforts, leading to a 15% improvement in customer retention rates. Additionally, the interactive dashboards provided real-time insights into inventory levels, reducing stockouts by 25% and improving overall supply chain efficiency.

✅ Here's what I discovered:

✤ Task 1 - Framing Business Scenarios
Provided with an "online retail store" dataset, I focused on analyzing its contents to anticipate strategic concerns. This involved developing and framing impactful, data-driven questions specifically tailored for a CEO and a CMO. This exercise significantly enhanced my ability to connect raw data with high-level business objectives and formulate precise inquiries to guide further analysis.

✤ Task 2- Choosing the Right Visuals
Through multiple-choice questions, I gained knowledge on selecting appropriate graphs and charts that effectively represent data. This helped me understand the importance of visualizing data accurately.

✤ Task 3- Creating Effective Visuals
I delved into Power-BI and explored various techniques to craft captivating dashboards.

✤ Task 4- Communicating Insights & Analysis
I identified areas for improvement and effectively conveying findings and insights. This project emphasized the importance of clear communication in data visualization.

## 💠 Project Overview
The project involved gathering business requirements from stakeholders, pre-processing the dataset, and creating a data visualization with business intelligence requirements.

This dashboard is divided into two sections as Revenue analysis and Quantity analysis. This helps to analyze the overall data in two different perspective.

## 💠 Data Source
Online Retail Data : This data is from Virtual Internship on Forage from Tata Group on "Data Visualization: Empowering Business with Effective Insights".

## 💠 Tools
- Excel - Data Cleaning

- PowerBI- Creating Dashboards, Data Visualization

## 💠 Project dashboard includes:-
Project Dashboard Includes :

Sheet 1 : Details of Revenue

Sheet 2 : Details of Quantity sold

## 💠 Data Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

Data loading and inspection.
Handling missing values.
Data cleaning and formatting

💠 Insights :-
➤ Analyzing the entire data, the online retail business has gained  `14.27 Trillions revenue` , `4,373 customers` and has `407k Orders`.

1] 𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐓𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐬 :

* The data reveals that revenue remains relatively stable for the `first three quarters` of the year, from January through August. The average monthly revenue during this period is approximately `$1.15 billion`.

* A significant increase in revenue commences in September, continuing to an extraordinary peak in `October`, reaching `$5.65 billion`. While revenue drops in November ($3.39 billion) and December ($1 billion) from this peak, these months still demonstrate substantially higher sales than the preceding eight months.

* This analysis strongly indicates that the retail store's sales are heavily impacted by seasonality, with a pronounced surge typically occurring in the final four months of the year, culminating in a `dominant October performance`.

2]𝐂𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐲 𝐰𝐢𝐬𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 :

The visual shows how the top 10 countries which have opportunities for growth are performing.

The analysis shows that, countries such as the Eire, France, Germany and Netherland have high volumes of units bought and revenue generated.

3] 𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 :

* Revenue is heavily concentrated among the top customers, with the top two (IDs 14911 and 14646) generating overwhelmingly larger amounts ($2500.85M and $1066.49M, respectively).
* There's a steep drop in revenue contribution after the top two, indicating a strong power-law distribution where a few customers drive most of the sales.
* The remaining customers in the top 10 contribute significantly less, with the 10th customer generating only $14.62M, highlighting the importance of the very high-value customers.
